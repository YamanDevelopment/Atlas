During this meeting, we'll walk through how the portfolio is structured, the reasoning behind the investments chosen, and the balance of risks and opportunities it presents. If you weren't able to make it to our first meeting, that's completely okay, you'll still be able to jump right in and follow along. We'll make sure everyone has the context they need to get involved. This is a great chance to get a deeper look at the fundamentals of portfolio management, whether you're brand-new to investing or already have experience. We'll also open the floor for questions and discussion, so you'll have the opportunity to share your thoughts and learn from your peers. By the end of this session, you'll come away with a stronger understanding of how investment strategies are formed and how you can play an active role in shaping the future direction of our club!",

All are welcome, regardless of faith or non-faith background.   Vision Board Workshop 8/28/25 Join us as we create vision boards as a way to visually express your hopes, values, and goals. This creative exercise will help you reflect on where you sense God (or the sacred) is leading you, setting the tone for deeper spiritual direction conversations throughout the semester.",

As part of the illustrious sisterhood of Sigma Gamma Rho, we hold dear to our hearts high scholastic achievement, genuine community outreach, and the elegance that distinguishes successful young women from girls.     In the Spring of 1990, there was a need to finally complete the list of historically black sororities at the University of Central Florida. Therefore, with the help of the Delta Mu Sigma Alumnae Chapter , Lambda Mu's Herstory was created. The void was filled by nine vibrant young women. These women represent four different countries: Antigua, Italy, the Philippines, and the United States. Their main focus of studies concentrated in the following disciplines: the study of life, educational development, business, and the intricacy of engineering. They are the Sorors of \"NINE LIVES\"",

      "description": "Caribbean St udents' Association at The University of Central Florida History The Caribbean Students' Association at the University of Central Florida (CSA at UCF) has a short and colorful history. In April 1985, the idea for a Caribbean Club was concieved and acted upon by a few dedicated students, who spent many days trying to solicit enough signatures to officially activate the organization. The Caribbean Club, as it was called, served as a \"home away from home\" for the many Caribbean students at UCF. The club was formed with the purpose of fostering a cultural bridge between the Caribbean and the United States. In the Spring of 1990, the club was reactivated. It was tough in the beginning, but the hardwork and persistence finally paid off in the Spring of 1992 when the Caribbean Students' Association was officially formed and the membership blossomed from 15 to 100 members. The hard work and persistence finally paid off.  The Club meetings provide a relaxed atmosphere for students to meet and network. Students of all cultures were encouraged to share their Caribbean heritage while keeping the traditions of their Caribbean ancesto rs. Today, our membership has increased to over 300 students. Dedicated members are the key to the success of CSA. In 1992 our Association at UCF became one of the five educational institutions that started the Florida Caribbean Students' Association and is one of the initial five organizations at UCF to become apart of the university's MultiCultural Student Center. Today, CSA is one of the most active Student Organizations on the University of Central Florida campus.

      "description": "Omicron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honor Society, was founded December 3, 1914 at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia by 15 student and faculty leaders. The founders formulated the idea that leadership of exceptional quality and versatility in college should be recognized, that representatives in all phases of college life should cooperate in worthwhile endeavors, and that outstanding students, faculty, and administrators should meet on a basis of mutual interest, understanding, and helpfulness.  O&Delta;K¬Æ was the first college honor society of a national scope to give recognition and honor for meritorious leadership and service in extracurricular activities and to encourage development of general campus citizenship. Since its founding, Omicron Delta Kappa has initiated over 300,000 members. The Society recognizes achievement in the following five areas: Scholarship Athletics Campus or Community Service, Social or Religious Activities and Campus Government Journalism, Speech and the Mass Media Creative and Performing Arts   If you are interested in joining, please visit our website to complete the online application at: https://membership.odk.org/audience/prospective_members/membership_application_form",

Goals SoberKnights seeks to support UCF's goal of becoming a more diverse and inclusive community by educating and supporting both students and staff. Our main goal as an organization is to create a nurturing environment for UCF students in recovery. Another equally important goal is to break through the stigma surrounding addiction. Many members can attest to the stereotypes that are subconsciously projected upon anyone in recovery: \"moral failing\", \"junkie\", \"untrustworthy\", \"degenerate\" ‚Äî a few phrases that are sometimes associated with addiction. None of these are true of those suffering from addiction! Students in recovery from addiction are just as capable as any other student group, and SoberKnights wants to make sure UCF's community knows this.",

Our desire is to see college students transformed through knowing Jesus, being plugged into the local church, and impacting our city and the nations with the Gospel.   We meet weekly in what we call \"Lifegroups\" to connect, share how God is moving in our lives, encourage and pray for one another, spend time in worship, and have biblical discussions. Our Lifegroups meet different evenings of the week both on and off campus so there should be a good fit for anyone's schedule!   We also meet weekly with the rest of our church on Sunday mornings at 10:30am.   For more information on where we meet, what we believe and upcoming mission trips please check out our website: AntiochOrlando.com",

      "description": "During the fall of 1989, the foundation of Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. was commenced by collegiate women who recognized the need to form an organization that provided empowerment to women of all cultural backgrounds. Their humble beginnings were built at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa where their vision was to create a network of academic and social support for all women/nonbinary. Under the guidance of Esther Materon Arum and Mary Peterson, the vision came to fruition on April 9th, 1990, as the University of Iowa Panhellenic Council officially recognized the organization as a sorority. Through the continued commitment and leadership of the founding mothers, the operation of Sigma Lambda Gamma has thrived on many college campuses and provides an avenue for educational excellence to women of many nationalities. Our members recognize the need for togetherness and support among members of varying cultures at the university level and they remain dedicated to the overall success of members in a global environment. Sigma Lambda Gamma is a sisterhood/siblinghood of members who have chosen this affiliation as a manner to achieve personal development and awareness to the responsibility of community involvement for the betterment of our local, regional, national and global communities through the efforts of a network of close to 3,000 sorority members. Furthermore, we continue to be a pioneer in the Greek fraternal world through development of innovative programming initiatives, such as the Young Women's Leadership Program and Emotional Intelligence. Today, Sigma Lambda Gamma is the largest and fastest-growing multicultural sorority with a multicultural membership in chapters and alumnae associations throughout the United States ‚Äì from Arizona to Wyoming; Florida to Minnesota; New York to Texas; and many more states between the coasts of California and Rhode Island. A criterion for membership into Sigma Lambda Gamma is open to members of exceptional morals & ethics with a demonstrated commitment to academic excellence, and who are pursuing or have completed courses leading to a degree in an accredited college of university. Sigma Lambda Gamma is welcome to women, trans women, and nonbinary. Culture is Pride, Pride is Success.",

We believe that college can be an overwhelming time, and that we don't have to go through it alone ‚Äì through supporting one another, we become beacons of hope on our campus, in our friendships, in the workplace, and in the world.    HOPE's mission is to create a community where students of all backgrounds and fields of study feel supported, destigmatize conversations about mental health, build meaningful relationships, and engage in self-care and high-impact community service.    A key goal of HOPE is for all of our members to take suicide prevention training, such as Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR), at least once during their time as a Knight!    Our club offers:    Mentorship program: Students are matched into groups of 3, with at least one upper-class student mentor. Each semester centers around a new theme related to mental health (self-care, volunteer service, building community, etc.)  High impact volunteer opportunities: We prioritize opportunities where students gain hands-on experience with populations in need and serve their community in meaningful ways.   Suicide Prevention Training: Our club hosts QPR sessions each semester and promotes opportunities in the community.  Professional development events: We host guest speakers in the fields of psychology, mental health, and related fields for interactive workshops.  Socials: Fun events for students to network, make friends, and practice self-care.  Our goal is to unite students across professions who want to be mental health advocates in their communities. ",

The UCF chapter may seek to provide students with meaningful volunteer opportunities that allow them to make a difference in the lives of others.

The UCF chapter may strive to educate the local community about the importance of addressing this problem and encouraging more people to get involved in helping seniors. Perfect Pair is a non-profit organization, and the UCF chapter may need to fundraise to support their efforts. The chapter may organize events and activities to raise funds that can be used to support their programs and cover the costs of providing activities and resources for the seniors they serve.",

Join our Discord for updates and connect with members! https://discord.gg/phUHGKvG   We are the UCF student-chapter of the world's foremost technical society dedicated to the aerospace profession, AIAA .   Our student section is one of the largest registered student organizations (RSOs) on campus and the largest chapter of AIAA in the nation. We are primarily comprised of students majoring in Aerospace, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering alongside Computer Science, but we welcome any interested students at UCF.   AIAA UCF's main activities include general body meetings, hands-on projects, social activities, community STEM outreach, tours, workshops, and guest speaker events. While our projects each have their own timelines, AIAA UCF holds at least one general body meeting a month; to keep with tradition, usually on the first Thursday of the month.   In 2025-2026 we continue to showcase our repeating projects of Rocket Design, Quadcopters, Hovercrafts, Aviation Vehicle Design (AVD), and Design Build Fly (DBF), along with two new experimental projects: VTOL and our very own high-powered rocketry project (Project Horizon). These projects all begin after our first general body meeting the first Thursday of September so be sure to show up for project presentations and an introduction to the club with free pizza.   More information about AIAA UCF and paying yearly dues can be found on our website ! For current members and interested students, please join our Discord Server for all updates!",

Our mission is to provide the resources to help students succeed personally, professionally, and academically. To that end, we try to present interesting speakers and useful information at all of our meetings, to provide insights or education in topics ranging from career development and job-seeking, to research skills and technical writing, to work-life balance and mental health. We also host social events to give students a chance to take a break from classwork and research and to meet fellow students outside of their individual labs and departments. Additionally, our organization serves as an advocate, not only listening to the needs of our members and representing their interests with the CECS and UCF administration, but also representing the CECS graduate program as a whole in recruiting new graduate students and providing guidance and support to undergraduates considering applying to graduate school. Most importantly, we want to help build a community that unites graduate students across CECS, regardless of where they come from, what they're studying, or where they are in their career. In a world where STEM research and industry are increasingly collaborative, interdisciplinary, and interdependent, it's more important than ever to have a diverse network of peers to rely on for information, mentorship, and support.",

We are excited to celebrate our 25 years with you all! In the spring of 1999, DGC was created and was established as a council for culturally diverse Greek letter organizations. We pride on being an inclusive council whose mission is to promote scholastic excellence, cultural awareness, and community engagement. Currently we are home to nine different sororities and fraternities, each promoting diversity and spreading cultural awareness! Although DGC does not have a formal recruitment period, DGC hosts an informational event called ‚ÄúCultural Fair‚Äù at the beginning of Fall & Spring semester that allows students to meet our community, learn more about our chapters and values. We also host the \"DGC Yardshow\" towards the end of the semester where you can witness our traditions such as saluting, stepping and strolling. We know you‚Äôll find the home you‚Äôre looking for and we wish you a great year. Check out our Instagram @ dgcucf  for more information on our chapters and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at dgc@ucf.edu !

      "description": "          Lambda Alpha Epsilon is a co-ed pre-professional fraternity established in 1937. UCF's Delta Zeta Omega chapter at was founded in 1992. LAE alumni work throughout the country in a wide array of criminal justice agencies, including teaching CJ at the collegiate level. As a pre-professional fraternity, LAE prides itself in offering its members networking and community opportunities, fun social events, Bigs and Littles, and the opportunity to create friendships with individuals that pride themselves in the same interests: Public Service!           Every other week, LAE brings in a guest speaker, allowing its members to bond as a family and learn more about the plenitude of pathways one can take in CJ. Guest speakers in the past have included, but are not limited to, Orange County Sheriff's Office, FBI Terrorism Task Force, DEA, Orange County Corrections, Miami Beach Police Department, Victim Services, FDLE, and much more.           In the past, LAE has put together SWAT roundup, FBI hazmat training, and our annual Public Service Conference. These are just a few of the opportunities LAE prides itself in sharing with its members, all in an effort to help them feel more confident about their career choices post-graduation.           LAE is also very involved in its community with organizations such as Harbor House, Second Harvest, and Clean the World. We also host an annual Domestic Violence Awareness Charity Auction in October. Though a career-based fraternity, LAE encourages community and fellowship with its members by organizing events such as icebreakers, bowling nights, group workouts (possibly intramural sports), volunteer events, and Fall/Spring Formals.           Requirements: Members must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA, complete 10 hours of community service every semester, attend socials, partake in fundraisers, professional, and academic events, pay a semester fee, and meet bi-weekly 6:00 PM in our assigned location. All of this must be done to stay in Good-Standing. For more information and further updates, follow our Instagram @ucflae.

Though it is primarily aimed at those pursuing a degree in Environmental Engineering, the club is open to and welcomes anyone interested in the subject.  The club provides several exciting opportunities to learn and gain a deeper understanding of the profession outside the classroom. Guest lecturers come from all disciplines of Environmental Engineering, including wastewater control, air pollution control, and more. These professionals share insights into their careers, life after college, and offer tips on how to be successful in the field.  In addition to guest lectures, we have attended a variety of specific tours that provide valuable real-world exposure. These include energy plant tours, landfill tours, water treatment plant tours, and wastewater treatment plant tours. These tours give students a firsthand look at the operations and challenges within different sectors of Environmental Engineering.  SEE also holds several volunteering events throughout the year, giving students a chance to get outdoors and make an impact in local communities. Our involvement with FWEA and AWWA has included beach and river cleanups. In previous years, we have attended specific tours such as plant tours and industry conferences, providing valuable real-world exposure.    There are several chances to make a difference throughout the year. Please come out to one of our meetings or events and see what the club is all about!

KSES exposes UCF students to the event industry and is an excellent opportunity to learn more about possible career paths with events.   We have monthly meetings, including local industry guest speakers, site visits, workshops, volunteer activities, tours, etc! Some of last year's meetings included guest speaker Lindsey Brinson from Camping World Stadium, a tour and information session with Bill Dewitz from Encore, and while doing several site visits to places like Camping World Stadium, Orlando Convention Center, and Vu Orlando! Our meetings are a great way to immerse yourself in the event world and will allow you to learn and network with local professionals from all realms of the industry.   Since we are the ILEA Orlando student club, KSES members have the fantastic opportunity to become an ILEA Student Member. You can be an ILEA Student Member for all four years, and we highly recommend it for Juniors and Seniors; student membership, however, is open to everyone! The benefits of becoming a member are endless and include being able to attend ILEA meetings, being a full member of the national society, and networking- to name a few! KSES will also notify you of numerous volunteer opportunities with ILEA so you can gain experience, which is a critical aspect of being successful in the event industry. The typical annual ILEA membership cost is approximately $500, but as a Student Member with KSES, the price is significantly reduced to only $50! Being an ILEA student member is not a requirement for KSES, but we strongly encourage it as it will provide you with excellent opportunities and is great for your resume and future success.",

The Sorority was founded in 1913 by 22 students at Howard University. These young women wanted to use their collective strength to promote academic excellence; to provide scholarships; to provide support to the underserved; educate and stimulate participation in the establishment of positive public policy; and to highlight issues and provide solutions for problems in their communities.

      "description": "Welcome to the official Knight Connect page for SHPE at UCF! The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community. This organization made its way to Orlando in 1988. Our Chapter focuses on the Hispanic population at the University of Central Florida. For our members, we offer workshops, discussion panels, information sessions, and much more to prepare our soon-to-be Engineers for the real world. Companies come to our Chapter to discuss a multitude of topics, such as how to write a winning resume, interviewing tips/techniques and what companies expect out of an entry-level Engineer. SHPE National's mission is to empower the Hispanic community, so we took it upon our Chapter to engage with the younger community around Orlando to inform them about the importance of STEM. We conduct school visits to middle and high schools through our SHPE Junior Program to present what technical professions are and how they affect our everyday life. We also monitor student competitions for SECME, a statewide program that enables younger student with hands-on projects with basic math and science applications. With almost 400 members, every day we're closer to reaching the entire Hispanic STEM community at the University of Central Florida. We are devoted to empowering our members to realize their fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support, and development. Leadership is a key element for SHPE and we encourage all members to become leaders within our organization. It's not only a great experience, but it allows you meet other students and Chapters.   SHPE UCF: En la Florida Central, &iexcl;Juntos sin parar!

Founder Eugenia Tucker Fitzgerald was just sixteen years old when she left her family to attend Wesleyan College. At such a young age and during a time when it was rare for women to go to college, she recognized the importance of women coming together for personal development and improvement. She and her five closest friends founded the Adelphean Society.

      "description": "In 1972 the first UCF rowing team was established under the guidance of Coach Dennis Kamrad. Rowing is one of the earliest athletic activities on campus, and was the first UCF program to win a state championship in 1973 and a regional championship in 1972. Since then, both the men's and women's teams have sent UCF rowers to national, international, and Olympic events. We are an extremely competitive team that has won several state titles within the past few years (men's varsity 8 - 2016, men's novice 8+ - 2018 & 2022, men's lightweight novice 4 - 2019, men's novice 4 - 2022, women's novice 4+ 2023, women's novice 8+ 2023) along with a national championship in the women's novice 4 (2022), and has emerged as a well recognized and respected collegiate team.  Come try us out! If you would like more information about joining the team look for us on IMleagues at UCF,  email us at Ucf.Mensrowing.Recruitment@gmail.com or DM us on instagram @CentralFloridaRowing to get in contact with us",

Since 2004, Global Brigades has mobilized tens of thousands of university students and professionals through skill-based programs that work in partnership with community members to improve quality of life in under resourced regions while respecting local culture.   The mission of our Medical Brigade here in UCF is to provide comprehensive health care in rural communities with limited access to healthcare by having volunteers work alongside local licensed medical professionals. Our current focus is in Ghana, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Greece and Panama. Medical Brigade volunteers have the opportunity to shadow licensed professionals in consultations and assist in filling necessary prescriptions under the direction of a licensed pharmacists. Each of our partner communities receives a brigade every 3 to 6 months where hundreds of patients are provided one on one consultations, public health workshops, and given the proper medication or referral. Electronic patient records are collected through Data Informatics to monitor overall community health trends. Between brigades our in-country team maintains relationships with the communities to provide follow-up care and education.    Volunteer brigade participation may vary based on the medical background and skill of the volunteer. Volunteers with little to no medical experience have the opportunity to assist during triage, shadow doctors during consultations, deliver educational workshops, and help pack medications under the supervision of a local pharmacist. All patient consultations as well as the prescribing of medications is done only by licensed doctors. Regardless of medical skill level, all volunteers contribute to the clinic. Furthermore, volunteers have the opportunity to learn about providing sustainable healthcare to rural communities who would otherwise have limited access.

      "description": "\"Latin by Tradition, Not by Definition\" In the spring of 1999, after many years of trials and tribulations, 15 outstanding ladies established the Beta Theta Chapter. This made it the 31st chapter of Lambda Theta Alpha, the first Latin organization in the nation. Its purpose is to cater towards the needs of women on the UCF campus. Along with the accomplishment of the establishment of a chapter, the Founding Sisters of Beta Theta Chapter also established and fought for recognition of the Diversified Greek Council by the Greek community at UCF. This was a monumental accomplishment for Beta Theta chapter. Once the Diversified Greek Council was established and recognized, other multicultural Greek organizations were able to start a chapter on campus. On November 4, 2000, Line One was added to Beta Theta. This group of ladies had realized a long-standing goal of theirs when they were welcomed into the Lambda Theta Alpha sisterhood. Eventually, eleven ladies succeeded and became what is known as \"The First Dynasty.\" From then on the legacy of Beta Theta continues to grow with high quality ladies that are determined to leave a mark on campus and in the community. Through various community service projects and educational programming, Beta Theta is making a difference. We are determined to give back, not only UCF but, the Central Florida community. Whether it is telethons with Arnold Palmer Hospital to help raise money for the cancer wing, or giving out food to the homeless, our sisterhood strives to help those in need. Beta Theta also does workshops on issues that can affect everyone, such as self-defense, as well as enlighten others on people and various walks of life. It is our hope to break down barriers within our community and to dissipate ignorance. We strive to become leaders and inspire other women to stand up for their beliefs and never stop reaching for their dreams.

Our primary focus is engineering and science, but all are welcome. It takes more than engineers to run a space program!   Projects KSC operates several projects to provide hands-on experience to our Members. We are currently developing two suborbital, balloon-based CubeSat test platforms that will fly up to 100,000 feet. We are also in the early phases of an orbital CubeSat mission. To communicate with these satellites, we are working on satellite ground stations on UCF's Engineering Building and Physical Science Building. We also build payloads for amateur rocketry projects in collaboration with other UCF RSOs.   Workshops KSC offers several workshops each semester. Leading up to career fairs and internship application periods, we hold professional development workshops to provide Members with valuable information and advice from recruiters and industry professionals.   Industry Tours and Conferences KSC partners with local Florida aerospace companies to offer industry tours giving Members valuable insights into their future career and direct connections for internship applications.

Each Sport Club is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) with the Office of Student Involvement (OSI). Sport Clubs exist to promote and develop interest in a particular sport activity. Interests may be competitive, recreational, instructional or any combination of the three. Participation in Sport Clubs is strictly voluntary and membership is open to all currently enrolled UCF students who are paying the Activity & Service Fee. As RSO's, clubs are developed by students for students under the supervision of the Recreation & Wellness Center. The Sport Club staff of the RWC believes that involvement in the Sport Club Program enhances development, leadership, and the overall college experience for students by supplementing skills learned in the educational realm. It is the mission of the program to provide diverse sports opportunities for all students across a broad range of skill levels and experiences. We include the following clubs: Badminton                                               Baseball Bowling                                                   Crew  Cuong Nhu                                              Cycling Equestrian                                               Fencing Golf                                                        Ice Hockey Judo                                                       Kendo Kiteboarding                                            Lacrosse (M) Lacrosse (W)                                           Mixed Martial Arts Paintball                                                  Racquetball Rock Climbing                                          Roller Hockey Rugby (M)                                               Rugby (W) Running                                                  SCUBA Soccer (M)                                              Soccer (W) Softball                                                   Surf Swim                                                      Table Tennis Tae Kwon Do                                           Tennis TokuWakan                                             Triathlon Ultimate Frisbee (M)                                Ultimate Frisbee (W) Volleyball (M)                                          Volleyball (W) Wakeboarding                                         Water Polo (M) Water Polo (W)                                        Wrestling",

Throughout the year, we host several events and socials that exemplify each of those principles. We provide leadership opportunities for our members in a fun, supportive environment.    The Black Female Development Circle is an organization of African American women that came together at the University of Florida in 1994. The group was founded to serve as a support system for black women. Meetings were to be a place where women with similar experiences could come together to discuss current events and find comfort from women who could relate to them. Since that time, collegiate chapters have been established at The University of Central Florida, University of South Florida, UConn, Flagler College, and the University of Miami.

First Step believes that underclassmen are capable of achieving such positions and are just as ready for such learning and technical applications as underclassmen are. It is the idea that the underclassmen have time to accomplish their goals that \"justifies\" them to wait until they are juniors or seniors to get internships/research experience that mentally blocks the first years from thinking that they can achieve greatness within their first year of university. Underclassmen have the capability of excelling in the industry as they stand.  First Step hopes to inspire and lead them to all of the opportunities that are available through an engineering and computer science mentorship program . Here, members are grouped with peer mentors who have obtained research and/or internship experience in their early undergraduate semesters.",

Christians on Campus has many chapters on many campuses throughout the nation but does not take direction from any central headquarters or organization. Instead, the members practice to fellowship with other clubs from the various campuses in semesterly gatherings and yearly conferences. Through the decades of the Christians on Campus ministry, many graduates are kept connected to the students from the campus where they graduated, and are easily plugged into another campus should they move to a new city for work or graduate school. These alumni are very useful in mentoring new students due to their previous experiences as students and their current professional development. Our goals are threefold: Our first goal is to cause the students to see how critical these college years are for their own pursuit of Christ, their education, and for their development in spirit, soul, and body. In addition, the club desires to produce many mentors who could carry on the care for the younger, incoming students coming to UCF. Secondly, our goal is to connect students with each other and with local Christian families and alumni throughout Central Florida and beyond to support the students in their spiritual condition, mental health, and academics. Finally, to equip all the students in the realization of the divine truths according to the Scriptures (2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:18), and for each one to realize the application of the Scripture in their daily living.",

Our sorority is composed of women and NBs who emphasize strong sisterly bonds with one another but also place importance on academics.We accept women/NBs in Engineering, Architecture, Mathematics, and the Sciences. While women/NBs have an ever-growing presence in these fields, we remain a minority in collegiate and professional arenas which can prove challenging. As a sorority, we offer women/NBs the opportunity to develop leadership skills, friendships, a sense of belonging, and a network of support. We encourage friendship - between you and your fellow sisters, fellowship - through shared interests, and commitment - to yourself, the organization, and your community. Support is essential while pursuing a degree in these technical fields because we all encounter the same challenges. A variety of activities is planned throughout the year for our members, including social, philanthropic, and scholastic events, to encourage a fun relaxed atmosphere without jeopardizing academics.

We have now expanded our educational horizons so that our students are well educated for citizenship as well as for careers. One of the most important attributes of the UCF college experience is community engagement, which enhances one's personal and professional life. By serving others, students develop the ability to lead, to communicate effectively with diverse populations, and to understand complex issues within their community. Through the Honors Freshman Symposium, Elevation Fellows Program and the Honors Educational Reach Out (HERO) opportunities, the number of students who are interested in, excited about, and involved with community engagement at The Burnett Honors College has grown tremendously over the past five years. These opportunities provide students with a chance to contribute to their community, to take what they have learned in the classroom and the knowledge that they have acquired from their college experience and apply it for a greater good. By being engaged citizens, students not only make connections within the broader community, but also make connections within their respective student community. Being civically responsible affords students the chance to serve as leaders and mentors, communicate their shared interests and passions, and collaborate to change the way that future generations think about their livelihood.",

We will have educational meetings with businesswomen that have excelled in the workplace and will provide several social networking opportunities for members to build strong relationships and gain connections to big opportunities.  Gaining internships and job offers is incredibly important for student success upon graduation. It's no secret that men have been favored by employers in most business professions, notably finance, accounting, and investments, among others. There is a noticeable wage gap between males and females. Because of this, we see that women are still at a large disadvantage in professional environments.

Medical surplus is any expired medical supplies or medical supplies that is unexpired and unused. Usually this expired medical supplies is in decent condition and can be used to an extent. The condition of medical supplies will be examined by the recipient. Unexpired medical supplies maybe be donated to us in the case that a Hospital changes the brand of supplies and must remove all of the previous brand's merchandise by discarding them.  What will we do at events? Our events will include sorting medical supplies into 10 categories based on the medical device's use (e.g Urology, Cardiology, Surgical). Then we would inventory each item into a spreadsheet using a program called Orcascan. The program allows us to scan a barcode or QR code on the device and automatically log it into a spreadsheet.",
